title: Get LXDE
---

You have a handful of ways to try out LXDE.

#### But I am totally new to those Linux things

We encourage you to try out Fedora LXDE

<ul class="actions">
  <li><a href="https://fedoraproject.org/spins/lxde/" class="button special">Get Fedora LXDE</a></li>
</ul>

#### I'm not new, but I want to install something that comes with LXDE

Many distributions offer LXDE out of the box, such as openSUSE and Debian.

<ul class="actions">
  <li><a href="https://www.debian.org/CD/live/#live-install-stable" class="button special">Get Debian</a></li>
</ul>
<ul class="actions">
  <li><a href="https://get.opensuse.org" class="button special">Get openSUSE</a></li>
</ul>

#### I want to buy a low-budget computer with LXDE

If you want to buy a computer, you can consider getting a single-board computer
for a fraction of the price.  Many single-board computers preloaded LXDE as
their default desktop environment.

You could also consider getting a computer from a local computer recyclers and
ask them to install Fedora LXDE, or Debian on it.

Although it could run on the computers with RAM as small as 256MiB, We
recommend getting a computer with RAM of 1GiB or above for applications running
on it, such as web browser, video player and office suite.

#### I would like to compile by myself
