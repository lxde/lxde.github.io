#### Get LXDE and try it out

The first step of joining is always to download the software and try it out.

<ul class="actions">
  <li><a href="/get" class="button special">Get LXDE</a></li>
</ul>

#### Test LXDE

Users are not only consumer. We believe users can be valuable contributors by
using and testing LXDE and by offering their feedback. We invite you to test
components from LXDE subversion for bugs. Please check out the bug tracking
system at Sourceforge and start testing LXDE.

<ul class="actions">
  <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/lxde/bugs/" class="button">LXDE Bug tracker</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/pcmanfm/bugs/" class="button">PCManFM Bug tracker</a></li>
</ul>

#### Translate LXDE and the projects documentation

Do you speak more than one language? LXDE is 100% volunteer translated, which
means you can be part of the LXDE translation project translating the software
and documentation thousands of people will use. Please visit the links below
for detailed information:

<ul class="actions">
  <li><a href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/lxde-i18n" class="button">Mailing List</a></li>

  <li><a href="https://forum.lxde.org/viewforum.php?f=12" class="button">Forum Board</a></li>
</ul>

An easy way to join translation is also to start translating wiki pages. Check
out the wiki in your language at [our wiki](https://wiki.lxde.org). If your
language is not listed yet and you would like to be a maintainer of wiki
content, please contact us us and we will set up a wiki in your language.

#### Become a Developer and Submit Patches/Code Contributions

LXDE is a Free and Open Source project started in Taiwan in 2005 with the
publication of the first component PCManFM. We are excited to join up and work
together with people from all over the world. If you see a bug in the
bug-tracker that you can fix, let us know and then go for it! All the
information you need to checkout LXDE is on our Sourceforge pages.

#### Promote LXDE

Write about LXDE, publish fotos, videos or any media you can think of. LXDE
performs well on energy saving computers such as mobile devices and other low
powered devices. Not everyone knows about this. LXDE is useful and can help
many people in their lives. Support the community and promote LXDE. Write about
LXDE on your blog, in forums, in your local community zine, in newspapers or
simply tell others about it.

#### Support LXDE at Community Events

Set up a booth or a table about LXDE at open source community events! There are
many events of the open source community all over the world. The core team of
LXDE is simply not able to attend all events. You can support the cause of LXDE
by making the project visible. Register as a member of the LXDE community at
events, set up a LXDE info point and showcase LXDE.
